# ☕ The Ultimate Nitro Cold Brew Recipe ☕
This document will serve as a summary of my research over the last 6 months to understand the science behind what makes kick ass cold brew. This work has culminated in a recipe that if followed precisely should reliably yield amazing nitro cold brew coffee to rival anything you've ever had at Starbucks.

_What follows is a thorough account of my research and the scientific explanations behind everything that makes great tasting nitro cold brew, but if all you want is the recipe then scroll to the end_

## Bean Selection
The first step in truly amazing tasting nitro cold brew is the careful selection of your coffee beans. Pre-ground coffee is easy; However for properly top notch cup we are going to need to grind our own. This means sourcing a good quality whole bean, and if your experience with home brew coffee starts and ends with buying Folgers, then you may feel a bit overwhelmed by the variety of whats available. But when it comes to choosing a high quality coffee, there are only four primary characteristics that you need to consider.

1. ### Species:
	When we say coffee we are referring broadly to a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae, called "Coffea". Within this single genus, there are over 120 known species, but when you enter your local grocery store or coffee shop you are likely to only run into 2, Robusta & Arabica.

	"Coffea Canephora", known much more commonly by the name "Robusta" is species of coffee born from sub-Saharan Africa. It is known not for its taste, but rather its very high levels of caffeine. This makes Robusta a good candidate for cheap coffees like instant mix, or for the industrial extraction of anhydrous caffeine, but its earthy bitter flavor prevents it from being a real candidate for our cold brew. Thus we turn to its more refined and will respected brother Coffea arabica. Arabica is by far the most common type of coffee. It accounts for roughly 75-80% of the worlds total annual coffee production, and as such you will certainly be able to get your hands on some at your local market. When brewed more traditionally with hot water, Arabica is loved for its well-rounded hints of chocolate, nuts, and caramel, but when brewed cold can allow what are normally subtle notes to bloom. Cold brewing Arabica will yield sweeter hints like fruits and berries that will bring both a pleasant mouthfeel a brightness that really shines to make for a perfect cup to relax or get some work done on a hot summers day.

	**TL;DR: You want to choose an Arabica coffee variety**
    
2.  ### Country of Origin
	You may notice when you look up close at whole bean coffee bag that it will proudly display its country of origin. This detail is added not as some marketing ploy to make the coffee sound exotic and exciting (though I'm sure it helps) but rather because where a bean is grown can have quite a large effect on how it tastes. Ideal growing conditions for coffee tend to include anywhere with a moderately cool to warm tropical climate and rich soil. Because of this growing locations tend to center around the equator in a line known as the "Coffee Belt". The belt includes Central & South America, the Caribbean, Africa,  the Middle East; and even many Asian countries. While many factors like temperature, humidity, and climate will change from region to region; one of the biggest factors that will affect the taste is the altitude the coffee is grown at. Some countries like
